# HexChi 
(probably not final title)

Inspired by chi-band mana emissions from Ra.

Makes all media-consuming patterns record their media cost and caster's position to a dimension-wide map. These entries slowly decay until they reach some lower threshold, at which point they are removed.

Adds a couple of patterns that allow you to detect the entries, and a great spell that counts as costing several times its true cost for the purpose of media emissions.

Might include some method of cleaning up these emissions before their natural expiration, not sure what form that would take.
