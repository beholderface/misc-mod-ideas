Hex tamagotchi that you take care of in exchange for access to various useful abilities.

You feed it media on a regular basis to keep it happy.

The tamagotchi is an incorporeal media entity, which you bind to yourself using a great spell. You can only have one at a time. You can sever your connection to it, but doing so is expensive.

If it is unhappy, trying to use its power has a high chance to mishap.

If you feed it a live allay, something snaps inside of it, and it goes berserk.
