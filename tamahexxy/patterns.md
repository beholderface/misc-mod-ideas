- Feed: Present the tamagotchi with a block or entity. Various effects depending on its mood. Feeding it raw media items will almost always succeed, but other things may be rejected, or used against you in some way. Effectiveness also varies based on method of casting, with manually drawing the pattern being most effective.
- Channel: Attempt to use the tamagotchi's power on a target, modified by an optional argument. Using this always negatively effects its mood, with the magnitude of the effect depending on how much you've used it recently and its preexisting mood levels.
- Observe: Returns information about the tamagotchi's mood. Sometimes it will feel like a specific item, and giving that to it is guaranteed to boost its mood, and potentially magnify secondary effects associated with the item.
