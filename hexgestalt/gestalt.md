You somehow entangle your own mind with many others (villagers will do, but so would other (willing (or tricked)) players, and maybe piglins), such that they all work together in a gestalt consciousness capable of perceiving Nature to the greatest extent that a finite entity can possibly achieve.

This gestalt has enough combined mental "force" to pierce the barrier described in A Frustration, granting the ability to cast great spells, even if the connection is severed.

The gestalt state requires each component mind to remain within a certain distance of each other in order to function, but while active it grants Clarity to each connected entity, at a level scaling with the number of minds in the network (limit 5, probably requiring at least twenty entities). Additionally, it allows casters to clear their staff grids without also clearing their stacks (intro/retro stuff included), though it does null any references to entities that aren't part of the gestalt.
